The Art of Query Design \u00b6 Creating new Tellor query is pretty simple - there are only a few steps. Along the way, though, there are some important considerations and decisions to make so that Tellor's oracle data serves your project well. Here's how to get started. Step 1. Give the query a name Call it anything, really (within reason of course). WeatherReport , GameScore , ElectionResult , PropertyOwner , or anything else you can imagine. We call this the Query Type . If you stick with CamelCase names, it would really help us out, so thanks in advance! Step 2. Choose query parameters (if you want to) A Query Type can also have parameters that serve to customize the response. For example, PropertyOwner might have a parameter called address . GameScore might have a few parameters such as game_date , home_team , or away_team . You get the idea. It helps if you also define what values are allowed for each parameter . One last thing - we know it seems weird, but we'd love it if you named your parameters using SnakeCase . Step 3. Choose the data type Tellor's reporters need to know how you'd like your data served (medium rare, a side of fries?). When you think about it, reporters need to know the data type used to respond, such as float , int , string , bool`, raw bytes, etc. But don't stop there. Interesting queries can have complex responses with structured data types that can hold data such as weather reports, addresses, GPS locations, game statistics. That's the great thing about Tellor, you can have it your way ! Step 4. You make the rules Since it's your data used for your smart contract, you get to make the rules! With great power (to create arbitrary queries with arbitrary responses) comes great responsibility. Rules about your data are mainly to encourage Tellor's reporters to provide the data with a reasonable degree of confidence. Remember, reporters may lose their staked TRB if the network votes the answer incorrect! This is the part of Query Design that is more of an art . Be sure to carefully describe the expected response, including the conditions that you would expect for the value to be disputed and removed from the chain. Depending on your design, the rules can have a great impact on the security of your network. Step 5. Define data sources (if you want to) Another optional step here. Reporters will need to figure out how to get the requested data. If the rules are clear, you can leave it up to them - that's totally cool. Otherwise, you can point reporters in the right direction. Ideally there are multiple off-chain data sources to increase the robustness and decentralization of the feed. Sometimes there are specific API endpoints that have exactly the data that you're looking for. If endpoints are paid, you might have to tip reporters a bit more as an incentive for the feed. That's it! You've learned the art of Tellor Query design, including some important things to consider in the process. Please reach out to the integrations team on discord for more help in getting started. If you're a dev, you can continue reading for a detailed technical guide for adding new queries to the tellor network. Detailed Guide \u00b6 This section begins a detailed technical description of how to add a new query to the Tellor network. The process of adding a new query to the Tellor network involves three steps: Define the new query Register the new query Create a data source to provide data for the new query Technically speaking, the 3rd step above is not required, but it enables Tellor's existing decentralized reporter network to automatically respond to the query. Without this step, customers will be required to stand-up their own reporter network. Step 1: Query Definition \u00b6 To define a new query, the first step is to specify its Query Type . If possible, it's easiest to use one of the Query Types already defined for the Tellor network ( e.g. SpotPrice ). If none of the existing query types work, you will need to define a new query type . When using an existing Query Type, you'll need to specify the parameter values that correspond to the data you would like put on-chain. For example, when using the SpotPrice query, you'll need to specify the values for two parameters: asset and currency . It is important to note the difference between defining a Query Type and a defining a query . Defining a new Query Type creates an entire new class of queries, whereas defining a new query refers to an instance of a QueryType with the value of each parameter specified. To formally add the query definition to Tellor network, you'll need to propose changes to the Tellor Data Specification Repository . Step 2: Query Registration \u00b6 Registering the new query makes users aware of the query and lets reporters know how to respond. It requires proposing changes to the telliot-core repository , and must include two things. First, it must include a unit test for the new query. Using the pytest framework, create a unit test that creates an instance of the query and verify that the values query descriptor, query data, and query ID are sensible. Second, it must be registered with the Query Catalog . The example below demonstrates how to test a new query and register it in the catalog. Step 3: Query Data Sources \u00b6 A query DataSource provides a method to fetch new data points in response to a query. It provides an API that enables Tellor's existing decentralized reporter network to automatically respond to the query. Ideally, a DataSource should provide additional decentralization and robustness by fetching data from multiple sources and aggregating the result. A new DataSource is created by proposing changes to the telliot-feed-examples repository . Defining New Query Types \u00b6 If none of the existing Tellor Query Types works for your application, you can define a new Query Type . A new Query Type definition specifies: The name of the query type The data type or structure of the value expected query response (i.e. its ValueType ) Optionally, the name and data type of each query parameter Encoding method - the method used to encode the Query Type and parameter values into the query_data field used for Tellor contract interactions. It is important to note the difference between defining a Query Type and a defining a query . Defining a new Query Type creates an entire new class of queries, whereas defining a new query refers to an instance of a QueryType with the value of each parameter specified. To define a new Query Type, propose changes to the telliot-core repository defining a new subclass of OracleQuery that implements all required methods and properties. New users may choose between subclassing JsonQuery and the AbiQuery . These queries are identical in every way except for the coder/decoder that converts between the query name/parameters and the query data field used in contract interfaces. The latter format is recommended if on-chain read/write access to parameter values is required. Propose changes \u00b6 To propose changes to a Tellor repository, perform the following steps: Fork the tellor repository to your github account. Make the proposed changes in your forked repository. Submit a pull-request to incorporate the changes from your fork into the main tellor repository. Alternately, standalone changes can be proposed in a separate repository, but it is the user's responsibility to ensure compatibility with the telliot-core framework. Example: Adding a new SpotPrice \u00b6 In this example, a new SpotPrice query is defined for the price of BTC in USD. To add a new spot price, use the existing SpotPrice Query Type and simply define a new asset / currency pair. Example: Create and test the SpotPrice query for BTC/USD. from telliot_core.api import SpotPrice def test_new_query (): q = SpotPrice ( asset = \"BTC\" , currency = \"USD\" ) assert q . descriptor == '{\"type\":\"SpotPrice\",\"asset\":\"btc\",\"currency\":\"usd\"}' assert q . query_data == b '{\"type\":\"SpotPrice\",\"asset\":\"btc\",\"currency\":\"usd\"}' assert q . query_id . hex () == \"d66b36afdec822c56014e56f468dee7c7b082ed873aba0f7663ec7c6f25d2c0a\" Example: Add the query to the Query Catalog Add the following statements to telliot_core.data.query_catalog.py . query_catalog . add_entry ( tag = \"btc-usd-spot\" , title = \"BTC/USD spot price\" , q = SpotPrice ( asset = \"BTC\" , currency = \"USD\" ) )","title":"Creating New Queries"},{"location":"new-query/#creating-new-or-custom-oracle-queries","text":"If the Tellor oracle doesn't have the on-chain data your smart contract needs, this section should help you define a new query so that Tellor' decentralized network of reporters can get busy putting your data securely on-chain.","title":"Creating New or Custom Oracle Queries"},{"location":"new-query/#the-art-of-query-design","text":"Creating new Tellor query is pretty simple - there are only a few steps.
